## 25/08/2020 Overview 

_planned meeting to discuss and brainstorm optimal algorithm_

_Present Members: Blake, Donghyun, Gurpreet, Jason, Maric_

Tasks Before Final Submission (code) 
- [ ] Input/output handling
- [ ] Algorithm Design and implementation
- [ ] Visualization
- [ ] Parallelization

# Today 
##  Discussion 

algorithm to quickly find one initial schedule that further searches can be based off... 

HIGH TRANSMISSION WEIGHT ON SAME PROCESSOR  (GREEDY)

While there is unscheduled nodes {
Get available nodes
if(available node = 1) {
Schedule the node in the same processor
} else { 
schedule the node with the higher transmission weight* on the same processor. 
And schedule remaining nodes in free processor(s)
}
}

## To DO 
Form a Solution Tree from the .dot input 
Different Heuristics to find valid solution (one is already up there) + Some bound that we can use for pruning
